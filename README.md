# CENG4217-Project
Python Scripts to benchmark SV Calling algorithms. 

illuminaBenchmark.py is used to benchmark to tardis, delly and manta. It runs
these tools sequentally and performs some measuerements about resource usages. 

nanoporeBenchmark.py is used to benchmark to cuteSV, SVIM and Sniffles. It runs
these tools sequentally and performs some measuerements about resource usages.

VCF files and plots for measured data will be outputs.

statsVCF.py is used to get statistics of different VCF files and write it to a single "result.txt" file.
